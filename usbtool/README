In order to enter USB boot mode, you must prepare an SD card as follows:

Assuming /dev/sdi is your SD card device:

# sudo dd if=rom.bin of=/dev/sdi bs=512 seek=2

Note that you can actually have a fully functional card for storage and use
it also to enter USB boot mode as long as you partition it such that the
first partition starts beyond sector 17.
